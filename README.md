# Rando-User-Api-Project.JS
The objective of this JavaScript AJAX project is to use the Random User Generator API to retrieve a random user, and then output user information in the DOM. The cool thing about this project is the API that was introduced. Now, when I need to create a project with randomized user seed data, I know a cool API I can use. 

# Javascript Used
1. JavaScript XMLHttpRequest Constructor
